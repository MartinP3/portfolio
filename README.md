A simple overview of the use/purpose of the project.

## Description

This is my personal portfolio showing my latest works, which I'll continuously add to until I can start removing my earlier work that I'm less proud of.
I write a bit about myself, to give the visitor an idea of who I am and how they can get in contact with me.

my color choice was a dark background to try something new and light orange to be the difference maker for the design, and decided on having a nav for a 1 page site to navigate through the different parts of the site with nav names mimicking Visual Studio Code's look with greetings.html, myWork.html and etc after being inspired by my fellow classmate Chrinstonn93's layout.

## Built With

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

## Getting Started

### Installing

```
Clone the repository with GitHub Desktop
```

Or

```bash
git clone git@github.com:MartinP3/portfolio.git
```

### Running

I suggest using Visual Studio Code for editing the code and running the Live Server extension if you wish to avoid breaking your F5 key.

I would like to thank Christonn93 for sharing his site and giving me the idea to use this nav naming sense.
